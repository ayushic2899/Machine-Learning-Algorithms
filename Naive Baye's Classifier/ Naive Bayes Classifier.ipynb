    "It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as ‘Naive’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.\n",

    "### Advantages\n",
    "#### 1. Work Very well with many number of features\n",
    "It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also perform well in multi class prediction\n",
    "#### 2. Works Well with Large training Dataset\n",
    "#### 3. It converges faster when we are training the model\n",
    "When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.\n",
    "#### 4. It also performs well with categorical features\n",
    "It perform well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption)."

    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Correlated features affects performance\n",
    "2. One of the main disadvantage of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictor features. Naive Bayes implicitly assumes that all the attributes are mutually independent.\n",
    "3. If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\n",
    "4. On the other side naive Bayes is also known as a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously."

    "This algorithm is also well known for multi class prediction feature. Here we can predict the probability of multiple classes of target variable.\n",
    "#### 3. Text classification/ Spam Filtering/ Sentiment Analysis: \n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers mostly used in text classification (due to better result in multi class problems and independence rule) have higher success rate as compared to other algorithms. As a result, it is widely used in Spam filtering (identify spam e-mail) and Sentiment Analysis (in social media analysis, to identify positive and negative customer sentiments)\n",

    "## Types of Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "#### 1. Gaussian:\n",
    "It is used in Classification. It assumes that all features follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "#### 2.Multinomial:\n",
    "It is best suitable for classification problem which has discrete features. It normally requires integer features but decimal vectors will also work well.\n",
    "#### 3.Bernoulli:\n",
    "Like MultinomialNB, this classifier is suitable for discrete data. The difference is that while MultinomialNB works with occurrence counts, BernoulliNB is designed for binary/boolean features.\n",
    "The binomial model is useful if your feature vectors are binary (i.e. zeros and ones). One application would be text classification with ‘bag of words’ model where the 1s & 0s are “word occurs in the document” and “word does not occur in the document” respectively.\n",

    "## Here are some tips for improving power of Naive Bayes Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If continuous features do not have normal distribution, we should use transformation or different methods to convert it in normal distribution.\n",
    "2. If test data set has zero frequency issue, apply smoothing techniques “Laplace Correction” to predict the class of test data set.\n",
    "3. Remove correlated features, as the highly correlated features are voted twice in the model and it can lead to over inflating importance.\n",
    "4. Naive Bayes classifiers has limited options for parameter tuning like alpha=1 for smoothing, fit_prior=[True|False] to learn class prior probabilities or not and some other options (look at detail here). I would recommend to focus on your  pre-processing of data and the feature selection.\n",
    "5. You might think to apply some classifier combination technique like ensembling, bagging and boosting but these methods would not help. Actually, “ensembling, boosting, bagging” won’t help since their purpose is to reduce variance. Naive Bayes has no variance to minimize."
